# Data-Bias

The goal of your project: My project aims to analyze Google's Perspective API, an algorithm scoring how toxic a comment is, on its limitations

Links to any relevant API documentation: Google's Perspective API https://perspectiveapi.com/ (key will not be made public)

The license of your data and any source data: project will have MIT license and dataset will be published

A data type and description for each attribute in your data: please refer to (data.world link)

Any known issues or potential issues, such as sources of bias in collection: Perspective API is a work in progress, meaning that it still needs a lot of coding and testing to improve itself. In this project, I will only uncover one small part of how the API could improve. Further testing is still required.
